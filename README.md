# CS/ECE 3992 Computer Engineering Sr. Project
This course is for students with major status who are seniors within one year of graduation. In this course each student defines an engineering project that is selected with approval of the instructor. This project is planned and executed to completion over the course of two semesters.

There are several major goals for this project, which will prepare the students for industry or graduate work:

+ Define and complete a significant engineering project
+ Develop proposal and presentation skills
+ Project organization, planning, and teamwork skills

# Assignment Details

+ All assignments will be turned in via canvas. 
+ You will create a webpage or other repository where your project will be documented in real time
+ You will be required to attend on session of the ECE technical open house

## Engineering Observations Assignment (Due 11:59 PM 1/27)

**2-page PDF turned in via Canvas**

This assignment helps you understand the goal of this course and 
lets you get started to think about what a good engineering project means.
There are two parts of this assignment:

### Part I (page 1):

Engineers improve the life of those in the world around them by improving interfaces, adding capabilities, and fixing things that are broken. 
For this assignment you will keenly observe the every day world around you and determine what you, as a computer engineer, could do to improve it. Carry a note pad or cell phone and make notes of all the things that you observe over the next week. Turn in a report of identifying the improvement and sketch out your initial thoughts on how you would engineer a solution. The solutions should be realistic and feasible. Practice problem solving at a high level of abstraction and general project planning.

You will be graded on the problems set you identify, the problems having engineering solutions that you can identify, and your ability to define a reasonable project solution approach and effort estimate.

### Part II (page 2):

In this part, you need to watch the project videos from Fall 2020
and write down your comments for at least three projects.

+ [Virtual Reality Teleoperation Robot](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XLQnoL_HQWo)


## Resume (Due 11:59 2/5) and Elevator Pitch (In class)

**1-page PDF of your resume (with link to your personal page) turned in via Canvas + in-class pitch**

Sign up your pitch [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JfWZkEyoXdVLtHkiwOqk24G7WVhLWMCP113cSe9fgsQ/edit?usp=sharing)!

Create a short resume and quick elevator speech (no slides) that describe why other students in the senior project section would want to "hire" you into their team. Include the engineering skills that you enjoy and that you feel you excel at. You may also want to include areas where you have interest in growth and learning. List any time or accessibility constraints you might have. These would include that you already have a team and your project is half done, you have a work schedule that limits availability, etc. Also, provide a quick overview of interesting design ideas that you are keen to pursue.

Have fun. This must fit on one page, and the presentation may not be more than three minutes. Extra points for serious creativity.

You can have a look at the following resume examples:

+ [Yasin Zamani](slides/yasin-resume.pdf)
+ [Guannan Guo](slides/guannan-resume.pdf)
+ [Cheng-Hsiang Chiu](slides/cheng-hsiang-resume.pdf)

We have provided a [template](website/) for you to quickly get your website 
up and running. In addition, you will find the following links useful for building
a website:

+ [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): We suggest using GitHub pages to place your html soruces
+ [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/): Tutorial pages for learning html
+ [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/): Tutorial pages for learning bootstrap


## Project Website (Due 11:59 2/26, 3/12, 3/26)

**1-page PDF with link to your project website turned in via Canvas**

We ask you to use [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/) 
to highlight your team, project ideas, 
and implementation progress.
This page must be visible online to all members of your project plus the instructor
and the TA.
We understand during the project execution, things change quickly and 
you may switch to another team (though not recommended).
So, this assignment has three dues, and each due must be different from the other
and the next due should contain more progress than the previous one.

At a minimum, your project page should contain the following:
+ Project title
+ Team members
+ Project abstract (what is your project and why is it important?)
+ Proposed methods
  - how are you going to deal with the problem?
  - what resources do you need to reach the goal?
  - what are the potential risks involved? any mitigation/contingency plan?
  - how long does each method take?
  - what is the job distribution plan for each team member?
+ Timetable of project-related activities starting from 2/26 (inclusive)
  



## Proposal (Due 11:59 PM 4/23)

**5-10 pages of your final proposal turned in via Canvas**

This document will consist of a *5 to 10 page* draft of your final proposal. This draft will clearly identify the key idea of your project, why it is interesting, and add substantial detail on how it will be implemented. The draft will contain relatively complete and polished versions of the following sections: abstract, introduction, background and bibliography for sources used in these sections. A draft of the proposed work, schedule, and required resources need to be included. Be sure to include a risk assessment as part of the proposed work.

\begin{abstract}
Briefly highlight your project idea, objective, and items to achieve.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Give a more detailed introduction about your project idea and objective.
Specifically, you will need to highlight the following items:

\begin{itemize}

\item why are you doing this? why do people care about it?
\item a set of software- and hardware-level challenges in a \textit{high-level} view
\item a set of articles you want to cite, like this nice paper~\cite{nicepaper1}


\end{itemize}

You can create a Figure \ref{fig::intro} to showcase your project.
A nice figure is more effective than saying 1000 words.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{This is just a simple figure to highlight your project objective and why 
  should other people care it.}
  \label{fig::intro}
\end{figure}

\section{Challenges}

Here, go deep to your challenges at two levels, software level and hardware level.


\subsection{Software-level Challenges}

Explain the software-level challenges you encounter in your project.

\subsection{Hardware-level Challenges}

Explain the hardware-level Challenges you encounter in your project

\section{Proposed Project Execution Plan}

Go in deep how you are going to overcome the identified challenges and
write down any mitigation plan for the risks involved.

\section{Prototype}

Here, explain any preliminary results you have accomplished this semester.
This can be just a very simple prototype, but it should be something
meaningful for other people to believe in your proposed project execution plan.

\section{Team Members and Job Distributions}

List your team member names and the proposed job distributions.

\section{Timeline of Proposed Activities}

Draw a timetable or a timeline for the proposed activities 
you plan to accomplish in the next Fall semester.

\section{Broader Impacts}

Please answer the following two questions in two separate paragraphs:

Question 1: Does your project apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors?

Question 2: Does your project recognize any ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts?


\section{Availability}

List any sources, including a link to your project website,
such that people can access them.

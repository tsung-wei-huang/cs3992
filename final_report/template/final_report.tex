\begin{abstract}
Briefly highlight your project idea, objective, and items to achieve.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Give a more detailed introduction about your project idea and objective.
Specifically, you will need to highlight the following items:

\begin{itemize}

\item why are you doing this? why do people care about it?
\item a set of software- and hardware-level challenges in a \textit{high-level} view
\item a set of articles you want to cite, like this nice paper~\cite{nicepaper1}

\end{itemize}

You can create a Figure \ref{fig::intro} to showcase your project.
A nice figure is more effective than saying 1000 words.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{This is just a simple figure to highlight your project objective and why 
  should other people care it.}
  \label{fig::intro}
\end{figure}

\section{Challenges}

Here, go deep to your challenges at two levels, software level and hardware level.


\subsection{Software-level Challenges}

Explain the software-level challenges you encounter in your project.

\subsection{Hardware-level Challenges}

Explain the hardware-level Challenges you encounter in your project

\section{Proposed Project Execution Plan}

Go in deep how you are going to overcome the identified challenges and
write down any mitigation plan for the risks involved.

\section{Prototype}

Here, explain any preliminary results you have accomplished this semester.
This can be just a very simple prototype, but it should be something
meaningful for other people to believe in your proposed project execution plan.

\section{Team Members and Job Distributions}

List your team member names and the proposed job distributions.

\section{Timeline of Proposed Activities}

Draw a timetable or a timeline for the proposed activities 
you plan to accomplish in the next Fall semester.

\section{Availability}

List any sources, including a link to your project website,
such that people can access them.
